Some simple VIM functions I use for Scala development

Right now this isn't even a full VIM plugin yet, but just some functions and commands that I source from my vimrc (actually from init.vim).

They are very much tailored to my personal useage, so they're probably not very useful for other people.
I've shared them here since they may serve as inspiration.

## Prerequisites

These assume you have Derek Wyatt's excellent vim-scala[https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-scala] plugin installed.
